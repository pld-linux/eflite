+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B eflite
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+This manual page documents briefly the
+.B eflite
+command.
+This manual page was written for the Debian distribution
+because the original program does not have a manual page.

+.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
+.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
+.\" respectively.
+\fBeflite\fP is a program that is used as a backend for
+screen reader applications.
+It is usually not called by the user, instead it is invoked by
+the application which needs to output information via Festival Lite's
+speech synthesis engine.
+.SH OPTIONS
+This program does not have any options at this time.
+Instead, it's controlled by the data received via STDIN.

+.SH AUTHOR
+This manual page was written by Mario Lang <mlang@debian.org>,
+for the Debian GNU/Linux system (but may be used by others).
